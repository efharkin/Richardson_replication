Richardson_replication is a Python 3 implementation of the LIF and conductance-based neuron models described by Richardson et al. in

Richardson, Brunel, and Hakim. (2003) From subthreshold to firing-rate resonance. J Neurophysiol 89, 2538-2554.

Models can be found under `src` and corresponding unit tests under `tests`.
Some of the important findings of the original paper have been replicated under `replicated_figures`, and a corresponding writeup is provided under `doc`.

All code was tested and run on MacOS in an Anaconda environment described in `Richardson_env.yml`.
